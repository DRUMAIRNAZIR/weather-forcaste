Weather Forecast Project
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`code for the weather forecast.ipynb`) that demonstrates a weather forecasting system. 
The notebook includes code to fetch, analyze, and visualize weather data, providing insights into weather patterns and helping users make informed decisions.
Project Overview
The **Weather Forecast Project** is designed to:
- Retrieve weather data from an API or dataset.
- Process and analyze the data for trends.
- Visualize forecasted weather information.

This project can serve as a helpful tool for understanding weather trends and implementing basic weather forecasting models.
Features
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch weather data from a reliable source.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze various weather metrics (temperature, humidity, etc.).
- **Visualization**: Display weather trends using graphs and charts.
